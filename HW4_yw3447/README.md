| **Statistical Analyses	|  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Question to be answered | _H0_ | alpha | link to paper **|

t-test	| 1, listen or not listen to happy music duirng the task | categorical  | 1. Overall divergent thinking score | continious ratio | 2, gender, age | categorical, continuous | Is creativity higher for participants who listened to ‘happy music’ (i.e., classical music high on arousal and positive mood) while performing the divergent creativity task, than for participants who performed the task in silence. | overall divergent thinking score test group <= overall divergent thinking score control group | 0.0083 | [Happy creativity: Listening to happy music facilitates divergent thinking](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182210)|
correlation | 10, ten physicochemical properties of larval habitats(Temperature, Acidity,Turbidity,Electrical conducticity,Alkalinity, Nitrate, Total hardness, Chloride, Phosphate, Sulphate)  | categorical | 1, Larval density| numerical | 2, 15 species; 11 different habitates | categorical | 	How strongly and in what direction are physicochemical factors and larval density related | there was no significant negative correlation between physicochemical characteristics and larval abundance | 0.05 | [Correlation between mosquito larval density and their habitat physicochemical characteristics in Mazandaran Province, northern Iran](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005835) | 
Logistic Regression	| 1.credit score | continious  | 1.default or not default | categorical ||| 	How does application credit scoring determine the probability that a credit applicant will default on his/her credit obligation | there is no significant correlation between credit scoring and default rate of applicant | 1 | [Large Unbalanced Credit Scoring Using Lasso-Logistic Regression Ensemble](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117844)|

## FBB t-test: overall is *mean* (since they use t-test)
## logisic regression: the better way to phraase a null for regression is (IV is not a predictor of DV)


## Assignment 3
Reproduce the analysis of the Hard to Employ program in NY.

Did the Z-test and the Chi-squre test.

## Assignment 4

Group work with Zhiao Zhou(zz1749).

For the later two tests, use 201502 and 201506 citibike data. Used PLUTO shapefile and ArcGIS to determine whether a point is in certain polygon. File: MN.csv, BK.csv
Tests of correlation using the scipy package with citibike data.
