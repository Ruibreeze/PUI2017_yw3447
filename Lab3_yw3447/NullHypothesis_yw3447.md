### Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Null hypothesis:
fat setup: BMI 
diet group: only have two meals and no exercise
exercise group: have regular three meals and run 10 miles 
the BMI of group on diet decrease the same or less then that of excerise group 

H0: average percentage of weight lose by people in the test sample on a diet is less or the same as for the control sample on exercise  
H0: Pt <= Pc

Ha: average percentage of weight lose by people in the test sample on a diet is larger for the control sample on exercise  
Pt > Pc

**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.** (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children of smokers and non-smokers at age 1, 2, 3, and 4 years.

H0: the average IQ of children whose mother smoke (10 or more cigarettes a day) during pregnancy in the teat sample 
is the same as that for those whose mothers do not smoke

H1: 

**Contribute to the incidence of diabetes** 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.

H0: there is no spatial correlation between the prevalence of diabetes and the distribution of food deserts
H1:
