# Homework 3

I discussed Homework 3 Assignment 1&2 with Zhiao Zhou, Lingyi Zhang and Chun Chieh Tsai. Zhiao Zhou taught me how to fit a gaussian to the distribution of means in Assignment 1. Chun Chieh Tsai explained the logic of Dr. Federica's sample in Assignment 2.

I mainly followed Dr. Federica's instructions on Assignment 1 and 2.
I did everything else of this homework alone.


## Outline of what I did
### Assignment 1: Write an ipython notebook that demonstrates visually in a data-driven way the Central Limit Theorem. 

1. Plot Chi-square distribution, Normal distribution, Poisson distribution, Binomial distribution, and Gamma distribution.
2. Plot the distribution of means with different sample size of each distribution.
3. Fit a gaussian to the distribution of means.

### Assignment 2: Set up the work for data-driven inference based on CitiBike data. 

1. Form a hypothesis and assign a significance level.
2. Store the data in PUIDATA and read the data.
3. Plot the number of trips in Long time & Short time.
4. Add the statistical errors in the figure.
5. Normalize the distribution of trips.

### Assignment 3: Finish z-test lab and turn it in as a notebook.

1. Form a hypothesis and assign a significance level.
2. Store the data in PUIDATA and read the data.
3. Calculating the Z-statistic.
4. Draw a conclusion based on the result.
