**Figure 1:** NYC Energy usage (Site EUI (kBtu/ft_2)) for each Zip Codes.
Black shows the areas whose average Site EUI is below 77.05(<25% of the whole).
Blue shows the areas whose average Site EUI is between 77.05 and 86.25 (25% ~ 50% of the whole).
Green shows the areas whose average Site EUI is between 86.25 and 95.80 (50% ~ 75% of the whole).
Yellow shows the areas whose average Site EUI is over 95.80 (>75% of the whole).
Some areas have no color because the data there are outliers and are removed.
